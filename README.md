## My learning so far with current progress
###### Note:
- Every item in this list is **EXTRA** learning i have done on my own to better my knowledge. University courses and mandatory learning is not shown here.
- The courses marked with **Completed** are the ones that I got all the knowledge I needed from them
- The percentage shown is the progress of my reading. (36% means that if there are 100 pages in the course, I read 36 of them)
- Every course here has detailed notes taken on github on this account

# Learning recipes
- Learn by synthesis (by doing it yourself) as well as by analysis.
- Rewire your brain with belief and constant practice.
- Add sensory experience to engage more of your brain.
- Cultivate humor to build stronger metaphors.
- Step away from the keyboard to solve hard problems.
- Change your viewpoint to solve the problem.

### We want to use R-mode(intuitive side of the brain, non-linear) more than we have because the R-mode provides intuition, and that’s something we desperately need in order to become experts. We cannot be expert without it. The Dreyfus model emphasizes the expert’s reliance on tacit knowledge; that’s over here in the R-mode as well. Experts rely on seeing and discriminating patterns; pattern matching is here too.
- if you’re looking for global, holistic patterns, you need R-mode. If you need to analyze parts and look into the detail, then you need a more L-mode approach. For most of us, this level of specialization is how it is. R-mode sees the forest; L-mode sees the trees.

- According to Stanford University research psychologist Carol Dweck, author of Mindset: The New Psychology of Success [Dwe08], students who believed they could not increase their intelligence in fact couldn’t. Those who believed in the plasticity of their brains increased their abilities easily. PS: Think you can learn anything, mindset is everything.

- Use cross-sensory feedback to increase brain usage.
    - For instance, try fiddling with a paper clip or some sort of tactile puzzle while stuck on a tedious conference call or while pondering a tricky problem.
    
    - Write it down in your usual form.

    - Draw a picture (not UML or an official diagram; just a picture). What visual metaphor is appropriate?

    - Describe it verbally.

    - Engage in open discussion with your teammates; respond to questions and criticisms, and so on.

    - Act out the roles involved. (Any physical metaphors come to mind? We’ll talk a lot about metaphors shortly.)
