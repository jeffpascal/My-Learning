### Dreyfus model
- Rate yourself. Where do you see yourself in the Dreyfus model for the primary skills you use at work? List the ways your current skill level impacts you.

- Identify other skills where you are a novice, advanced beginner, and so on. Be aware of the possibility of second-order incompetence when making these evaluations.

- For each of these skills, decide what you need to advance to the next level. Keep these examples in mind as you read the remainder of this book.

- Think back to problems you’ve experienced on a project team. Could any of them have been avoided if the team had been aware of the Dreyfus model? What can you do differently going forward?

- Think of your teammates: Where are they on their journey? How can that be helpful to you?


### Get something to take notes on, and keep it with you

actions : 

- New Habits

Do morning pages for at least two weeks.

Hone a quick wit. Look for connections or analogies between unrelated things.

Involve more senses when faced with a tricky problem. What works best for you?

Read something different from your usual material, for example, fiction, not science fiction, and so on.

Try a different genre of movie, vacation, music, or coffee.

Order something you’ve never had at your favorite restaurant.

Turn each problem around. What can you learn from the reverse?

- Try This

Deliberately vary your morning routine or other consistent habit.

Hold a design session using Lego blocks or office supplies.[74]

Take a class or start a hobby that involves more R-mode processing. Work on it daily.

Use the buddy system: have a buddy help keep you motivated, and discuss your progress.

Think of a metaphor, or set of metaphors, that would largely describe your current project (it may be helpful to think in terms of something very tangible). Try to come up with a few jokes about it using metaphor or exaggeration.

Look at experts you know. What “quirky” habits now make more sense to you?

What words can you add to your workplace lexicon?
