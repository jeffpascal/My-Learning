### Dreyfus model
- Rate yourself. Where do you see yourself in the Dreyfus model for the primary skills you use at work? List the ways your current skill level impacts you.

- Identify other skills where you are a novice, advanced beginner, and so on. Be aware of the possibility of second-order incompetence when making these evaluations.

- For each of these skills, decide what you need to advance to the next level. Keep these examples in mind as you read the remainder of this book.

- Think back to problems youâ€™ve experienced on a project team. Could any of them have been avoided if the team had been aware of the Dreyfus model? What can you do differently going forward?

- Think of your teammates: Where are they on their journey? How can that be helpful to you?
